# EMF Talks - Transcriptions

This repo contains transcriptions of all the talks from EMF 2018 that were on the 3 main stages.

Some talks have been removed as those had opted out of recording/streaming so we felt it best not to publish the transcription.

All EMF Content is licences as CCBYSA [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/] anything you do with this content should be similarly licensed.

The content is currently organised as it was recieved from the Stenograpgers, eg by stage and day, there is no index at present, we would welcome Pull Requests to improve the structure of this. Simiarly the files are inconistently named as each Stenograpger used a slightly different format.

The `talks-list.txt` file is a list of all talk titles and speakers as taken from the You Tube playlist.

If there is something missing please raise an issue and we will endevour to investigate, if as a speaker you opted out of recording but would like the transcription either published or for personal use please raise an issue.
