>> We know almost nothing about tools. I mean, we know a little bit. It's like there's been a MK Ultra program. It's more like a monkey opening a box of tools and throwing them over their shoulder and doing a poo in the tool box.

>> Are you allowed to show that on the internet?

>> They can use rich imaginations. This is radio. I don't know why we have this weight on here. I'm gonna get rid of that. It's not one of the tools.

>> So what we do is every month or two, we wander around car boot sales in the Nottingham area and environs and root through boxes from house clearances for the undiscovered gems.

>> I like to think I know a tiny bit about tools, but I don't know anything.

>> Whereas I know nothing at all.

>> So we've chosen how many? One, two, three, four, five, six, and one is a bundle of tools, we're going to very inexpertly try and work out what each one of them are.

>> You can laugh along with us if you know what it is.

>> Do we have any tool experts in this vast audience? There's about a thousand people here, frankly. It's scary. Listen to the roar! We'll put that in later.

>> Can we get the ducks in here?

>> What ducks? Which ducks?

>> The ducks!

>> Should we start right to left?

>> The slides are in the opposite order.

>> Okay.

>> Just so people can play alongside in the audience. Numero Uno or whatever Russian is...

>> So you picked this out. Should we describe where some of these tools came from, first? We went to the car boot sale at the Nottingham Race course. One of my favorite boot sales.

>> This weekend, it was slim pickings.

>> It was. Why was that?

>> I don't know. Maybe they're all summered out after the heat wave. They've been there slogging in the heat and they're just tired of it.

>> I thought it would be packed, but I did not look at the weather. And apparently there was a big rainstorm forecast for later that day. And it did rain later that day. And that clears out the suckers. So no private sellers. Of people that have just cleared out their own sheds and don't know what anything's worth. It's all the hard-nosed house clearing...

>> Yeah.

>> People.

>> One South London geezer.

>> So most of these came from this one guy who was from Bermondsey, and he made the mistake of saying that one of the things he had for sale was worth 60 pounds on eBay. But he wanted 2 pounds for it. I was like... If it's worth that much, why don't you put it on eBay? Who's got time... Anyway, what's this? Can I describe it for people? So it is a small sort of Bakelite plasticky thing with a big dial on the front that says Leningrad4 on the front, and it's in what I would describe as a faux alligator skin... Hang on. Is that real leather?

>> That's duck leather, that is.

>> What?

>> I don't know. Ducks on the brain.

>> This has been punched to make it look like alligator skin, and it has a little popper and a gauge on it, and I think it's probably a light meter, but I don't know much about it. Tell me what you know about that.

>> Russian shock photography light meter. So you can expose your people properly. I'll just turn the ISO down. Yeah. It's actually a film one. It's got lots of film camera settings on here. It's a beautiful...

>> So at least half of the audience are Millennials and don't know what this is for. I imagine that you hold this near your subject and you wiggle this little thing here to reflect how you've set your camera. When you could automatically set things like that up manually in the...

>> When you were using film. Set your exposure and your aperture.

>> And it says on here...

>> You're not gonna get a photo. That's what it says.

>> Yeah. It's too dark in here.

>> Yeah. Surprise.

>> And how much did you pay for that gem?

>> That one I paid a whole one pound for.

>> And do you think you'll ever use it?

>> No, no, no. I don't think I could even tidy that up. I would need to polish the plastic just to have it as a shelf piece.

>> Does it work?

>> The needle moves.

>> What does that switch do there?

>> I don't know. It moves some stuff. Maybe exposes...

>> Oh, look!

>> It's running.

>> I have no idea what I'm doing. That's lovely, Paul.

>> Thank you. Right, next. Let's go on to something where we don't know what we're doing.

>> Okay. So... I've got a thing and I'm holding it up for everybody to see. Oh yeah. A plier-like thing. We can pass them round.

>> I'm mobile!

>> Oh, hang on. We have to fight over it.

>> Okay. You can have one leg of it each.

>> That's a good idea. So now we actually can't see it or describe it. Oh, we've got it on the screen here. So this is a plier-like object.

>> Yeah, but the jaws are a bit weird.

>> Well, the jaws are interesting to me. They're in a configuration that probably has a proper technical name that I don't know, which means the jaws won't close like this, but they close like this. If anybody ever saw Kids in the Hall, I'm doing I'm crushing your head. I'm squeezing your face. They crush your head. They don't squeeze your face. It's hard to do things with your hands on a podcast. The force goes like this and not like... This. Which means... It's for putting something in something else straight. Have you any thoughts about this tool?

>> Okay. So... Again, this is something where through this weird relationship where we used to have kind of a friendly lingerie company in our offices, they used to do eyelets a lot. And they had a big version of this. You know, you would punch the hole in the material and then put an eyelet in and you would press it.

>> You're saying this is for putting, like, poppers into panties or something.

>> Or corsets. That kind of thing.

>> It could be for putting an eyelet in almost anything. But I agree. It's an eyelet tool.

>> It's got a punch.

>> When you activate the handles... I'm pointing at the piece that goes in over the top. This is fascinating stuff, isn't it? Does it do anything? Does something move? Who's got that tool? Thank you! Let's have a look. Yes! And you're right. It has like a bit that punches. Thank you, Robert!

>> Cool.

>> So that's like a hole punch bit. This is like the whole system. And I did notice it says made in England on it. So it must be pretty old. And it says Velos. But doesn't Velos mean bicycle?

>> It's probably a town in Greece somewhere.

>> Maybe. And it says number 950 on it. I don't know why I'm holding my microphone like that. I've gone a bit gangsta rap.

>> That's all right.

>> You set the tension here. And it's got an interesting arrow. It's got UX.

>> That just means where you put that piece in. That shape. And then you squeeze it like that and it does the business. What's that locking piece?

>> I think that just sets the depth. You can set how far your material goes in so you can get repeatable depth of eyelet.

>> That is a fantastic tool.

>> It's all right, that. Next...

>> I'm gonna hold it up.

>> Yeah.

>> And I'm gonna give it to Tanya to pass around.

>> Chief tool wrangler.

>> Okay! So I actually already have one of these. So what do you think it is, Paul?

>> I don't know. Again, these look like a set with the previous one. They cam over, they have a snippy bit on top.

>> Here's the thing. This is my top boot sale tool tip. Proximity does not create a relationship with tools.

>> But they kind of have similar things in similar places, so they must be related, right?

>> They have that same handle mechanism so they cut straight, but it's for grabbing wire. And doing things with wire. So if you want to straighten a piece of wire, and turn it on a right angle, you don't want to be pulling it like... This. I'm doing this shape with my hand.

>> He's doing big scissors, for people on the internet.

>> Like this, right? And then that bit there, the little jaw at the top, that's for cutting the wire. And I know this, because the one I have is a free gift from a wire company. And I was able to look it up. So I have one very similar. And they're really good for wire! Because unlike a plier, where the force is uneven across the holding part, the force on this is even across the whole jaw. So you can grab an inch and a half or whatever that is in new money, which I do know, but I'm on stage and my brain is now mush... And hold it really tightly without slipping out.

>> So this could be great for those kind of odd hairs as well. Because the tweezers I've got, the force is not even across them. So it's hard to hold.

>> That paints a picture. Ear hairs? The nose hairs?

>> Oh, don't touch those. It leads to tears.

>> Moving on.

>> Moving swiftly on. Look at the markings. Made in England.

>> And is there anything else on there? A lot of oily rust.

>> Yeah. Normally we would clean these up superficially. Wouldn't we?

>> Normally. Speak louder!

>> It's Wallasey, from Birmingham.

>> Clearly written on the other side.

>> Almost all tools with the exception of those made in Sheffield and London are made in Birmingham, pretty much. When you buy old tools, if they're made in England. Sheffield, Birmingham, everywhere else. Just observationally.

>> Next.

>> I went through a stage last year of going to a lot of boot sales and buying an awful lot of really heavy tools, which I ended up not really wanting.

>> I benefited from that. I stole some.

>> You think you benefited. I'm like... Thank goodness I got rid of that stuff. And I am someone that preaches quite a lot about not buying and hoarding broken old tools.

>> Yeah, I can see that from your workshop. Actually, no. Your wall of tools that you've recovered and repaired is beautiful. One of each in the right thing on a peg board. It's a thing of beauty. It's the cabinet on the back where you keep the other tools...

>> Moving on from my kleptomania... I don't steal the tools, by the way. I don't know what the right -mania is for that. So I'll hold this up, give it to Tanya. I'm not gonna give it to you. It's not school. All it is... Is it a pair of compasses?

>> A pair of compasseseseseseses...

>> I really like small, elegant, older tools like that.

>> I didn't like this one.

>> It's grown on you. I can tell from your face.

>> It's not solid. It's folded.

>> So tell us about this folded thing. I didn't notice this. You pointed it out later.

>> The pieces look like they're made from flat parts and folded with a form. Which always screams cheap tool to me, most of the time.

>> Oh, I killed my microphone! But it lasted... Oh, well. Show must go on. But it's lasted so long and it still looks nice compared to a modern one, which are cast out of some horrible... Um... What's the metal that melts very quickly? That one.

>> Yeah. Whittled from cheese.

>> Whittled from cheese. That's right. I wonder if one of the AV guys will come and fix my microphone? Because I'm an idiot? Here he comes.

>> We're gonna have to fight over the microphone now.

>> What I don't know is whether it fits a modern pencil inside it. Because it might be an old-fashioned size of pencil thing going on. I probably just turned it off with a button. But I really, really like it. And that will go in my pencil case instead of my modern one that I have.

>> What I will say is the tip on it looks pretty good. That looks like you could sharpen that, keep using it.

>> That'll take an edge, for sure. I can probably put that on the bench grinder and make it lethal, like a dart.

>> And it will mark metal and all of that. Just stay where it's told to.

>> I mean, the number of occasions in any given year where I actually need to draw a circle are less than one. But I am a tool hoarder! So there you go. Oh, moving on to the next lot.

>> So this was a value bundle. This was a whole toolfold that just felt kind of loved. There was one box there that was obviously from granddad's garage, and it had a lot of stuff in it. Again, a bunch of pliers. A complete set of pliers, which I love. And they're still pretty shiny. I don't know how good they are, but... Yeah! And they go right down to wee. And the action feels pretty good on them.

>> The action!

>> Look at that! Grrr.

>> Oh, get the action on those pliers! It's actually a bit loose, if I'm honest with you. So this is the sort... You know when I was talking about the cheapo cast metal that a lot of pairs of compasses were in the '80s? This is exactly that. You can see the casting line on the back here. They're not great quality things. Made in West Germany.

>> So they had kind of shortages and things, maybe. They had to make it out of whatever was around. I don't know. I mean, this AJ here is tiny and cute, but the jaws are deformed already.

>> I don't think it's a shortage thing. I think they're just low quality.

>> They needed to make a lot.

>> Which is pretty unusual for a German set of tools, if I'm honest. So let's describe what we have. A needlenose plier, a small plier, a slightly larger plier. I don't think they're from the same set. You've got... I think they call this a multitool.

>> So this is... The old screwdriver with different bits, before it all became modern. Nice plastic kind of jelly handle, with a slot with a key. Goes in there. Locks in, and then you can change the tip between all your different screws. They're pretty tarnished. But it's all still intact, so I think it didn't get much use. And now I can't get that bit out. So that's staying in there.

>> One of the bits is actually a gimlet! That's actually really nice. I didn't notice that piece before. So we've got one that's got a little screw head, and then like a... I don't know. How would you describe that? That has a name. That twisty drill-shaped thing. I don't know what it is. We're not experts, by the way! And you can push that in a hole and run it backwards and forwards, and...

>> Reamer!

>> A reamer. Let's call it that. So it's got a reamer. And then it's got one of these. Do you know what I think that is? I would call that...

>> Just a... It's just a socket, right? But why is that shape?

>> I actually think this is a bed spanner. For building a bed. (clicking tongue) an iron bedstead. A bed, Paul.

>> So we've got the professional tool kit of a bed builder?

>> It probably also fits a bike wheel, so it could be that. And looking at this little roll, it's much more likely to be -- assuming these aren't just tools that never belonged to it, it's much more likely to have been this and a few tools for a motorcycle or a bike. Oh, and what we failed to mention is the whole thing is in a lovely little roll. 

>> Lovely bit of green canvas, very simply stitched, from a more innocent time.

>> What do you mean? It's probably from World War II or something. That's not a really more innocent time.

>> Well, I think the West Germany kind of...

>> Yeah, maybe 1960s, 1950s, something like that.

>> More innocent, harsher times.

>> Thank you! He's just handing me a microphone. I think we've got another five minutes. The lady will hold the five minute thing up. Is it five minutes? Okay, we're fine. She's doing that hand movement. Speak more!

>> Basically the next talker isn't here, the next speaker isn't here, so we can waffle.

>> You say that, but they might be just hanging... Is it you? Oh.

>> As opposed to our highly focused chat so far.

>> Mystery Tool!

>> Yay!

>> Mystery Tool!

>> Yeah.

>> I had some strong opinions about what I thought this was when we picked it up.

>> I too have reasonably strong opinions. The guy who didn't have strong opinions was the guy from Bermondsey with the van. I know what that is. Capital, isn't it? What's the word, what's the word?

>> Everything he was selling was off the first class service of British Airways. Oh, that was used first class British Airways, that was. Bedding or something. Who buys bedding from a boot sale?

>> Hand drills.

>> Well, that's me. I don't buy bedding.

>> What do you use a drill for in first class in British Airways? Let's describe it for radio.

>> It looks like a catapult that's been drawn circa 1980.

>> A wide shape with an elongated leg and a curved top.

>> There's a hole in the... What do you call them? Tines.

>> The tines, the top of the Y.

>> When I saw it, I assumed... I think we can pretty safely say it's for loosening and tightening of something.

>> Yeah. So I have a similar thing for my lathe with only one side, where you use it to undo the draw bar.

>> How do you know if someone has a lathe? Don't worry. They'll tell you.

>> They'll tell you. Yes. Actually, no, I mean the milling machine. Oh my God, I really don't know tools. The one spinning that way.

>> Is it round and round this way or round and round that way?

>> That way.

>> That's not a lathe, Paul.

>> I might have it set up really badly.

>> You should mount it on the wall. Take up less space. I thought it was not for a lathe. I thought it was for an angle grinder, for moving the disc. But actually on an angle grinder -- I'm giving everyone the Vs. You don't have two pins sticking up like that. You have two holes and this should have the pins.

>> Maybe it was different back then.

>> What do you mean back then?

>> They couldn't afford pins back then. They had to have holes.

>> You're assuming this is old because it's rusty. It might have been left in a puddle.

>> It's really corroded.

>> It has absolutely zero quality to it whatsoever. Oh, five minutes.

>> Five minutes. We've got nothing left to talk about.

>> We're pretty much done.

>> Can we treat your mouse like an ancient tool?

>> No, I don't think so. We can take question... One.

>> But we don't know anything!

>> Well, I don't know. Has anybody got a question about the podcast or these tools? Lucy Rogers, Dr. Lucy Rogers?

>> What's your favorite boot fair find?

>> Um... I'll say what people always say when they can't think of an immediate answer. Well, that's a really good question! I don't know. I'll tell you my favorite boot sale find! And I have one. Not with me right here, but back at my village. It's called a footprint spanner. And you can get them in three different sizes. And they still make them. And it's just a wrench for tightening and loosening plumbing pipes. And they're just really good quality. And if you find them, they're usually really rusty and in terrible condition. But if you clean them up, then they're perfect. And often what's happened -- it has like a screw bolt that holds the spanner for adjustment. Often they're missing. And if you email Footprint, they'll send you a brand-new replacement screw for free. In fact, I've emailed them six times now! And on the third occasion, I said... Look, let me pay for these, because I'm just finding these at boot sales and doing them up. I'm not selling them on or anything. They said... No, we know who you are and we're happy with what you're doing. So I was like... Oh, all right! And that's my favorite. I have all three different sizes. The biggest one is this size and the smallest one is this size. But... Just to go further, adjustable spanners are my favorite things to find at boot sales, because there is hundreds of different types, and the guy that produced a lot of the Pink Floyd albums -- not a member of the band -- has written a definitive guide on the history of the adjustable spanner and you can cross reference the spanners against the book, written by the guy who produces Pink Floyd. That's how deep my nerdery goes on this subject. Paul, what's your favorite boot sale tool?

>> I'm just gonna say that's the most middle aged man thing ever. Well done. So now I'm going to take over and supersede it. Mine is a lot more obvious. It's vintage Stanley knife handles. Some of them have beautiful cross patterns on them. And they clean up lovely. They're very therapeutic to clean up. So they're my favorite find, always. Just filling in the collection of those. And you started me off with that. Because you had the lovely red one. And when they're finished, they gleam like the sun.

>> I will just say that... Actually, older Stanley tools, whilst they're not terribly great quality, they're great fun to pick up at boot sales, because every Stanley tool has a number, and with the number, it's quite easy to go back and find spares for it and stuff like that. And on that note, thank you very much for attending Bricolage Live! If you want to speak to me or Paul or just chitchat, we're gonna go out onto the lawn near that area over to the right there. And sign autographs. Thank you!
